Hello! I’m Ethan Casanova, a proud member of Nova High’s graduating class of 2025 in Davie, Florida. I’m passionate about cybersecurity, a field I’ve dedicated two years to studying in Mr. Abrantes’ course. I’m proud to be a three-time certificate holder in cybersecurity, demonstrating my commitment and proficiency in this rapidly evolving domain. My experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in protecting digital assets and understanding complex security protocols.
